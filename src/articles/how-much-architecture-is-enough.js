But this was a rather positive outcome, because as you can read I was in the position to __\"fix it\"__. The vast majority of us have experienced projects where they where working with a foundation that we would call \"interesting\" at best.

I would then also be happy to look at the face of the developer that will work on it after me, and will gladly tell him the functionality defined the architecture as the reason why the system ended up like this.  \n" +
